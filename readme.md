This is an early version of an ActiveRecord clone. So far, we have a BaseDatabaseConnection class, which is instantiated with a path to a local database. It parses the information in the database, and creates a new class for every table it finds. The classes have instance variables corresponding to their respective column's value, getters and setters for those, as well as generic ::find_by_attrib methods for every defined attribute. BaseDatabaseConnection takes care of maintaining a unique connection to that local db, and extends that connection to the classes which it creates.

The BaseModel module is what BaseDatabaseConnection uses to define the new classes which it creates. Right now, BaseModel supports a rudimentary object validation scheme, which ensures that new objects must be created with at least the number of attributes which its corresponding table declares as NOT NULL. 

As far as this exercises questions go, their answers can be found in questions_database.rb. It utilizes BaseDatabaseConnection to create the relevant methods.
